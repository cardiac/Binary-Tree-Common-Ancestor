Binary-Tree-Common-Ancestor
===========================

A series of attempts at algorithms to find the first common ancestor given two nodes in a binary tree.

All of these algorithms work with unbalanced binary trees and contain no optimization for a balanced version.

The A algorithm was planned out very quickly, immediately after viewing the problem and without any research.

The B algorithm is likely the fastest for a small binary tree.

The C algorithm is likely faster than B for a large data set. 

Instructions
============

Just run make.
