Binary-Tree-Common-Ancestor
===========================

A series of attempts at algorithms to find the first common ancestor given two nodes in a binary tree.

All of these algorithms work with unbalanced binary trees and contain no optimization for a balanced version.

The A algorithm was planned out very quickly is pretty much a mess, but it got the job done.

The B algorithm is likely the fastest for a small binary tree.

The C algorithm is likely faster than B for a large data set.
